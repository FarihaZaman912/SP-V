                    <p> Unbeatable beaches, unmatched luxury and a very happening underwater world makes Maldives worth 
                        it all! Endowed with incredible beauty and splendor of nature. With 1200 islands and 26 atolls, 
                        this island country holds a great allure for tourists across the globe for its exotic islands, 
                        enthralling blue seas, shiny-sandy beaches, magnificent reefs, and a variety of water sports. 
                        Being an island country dominated by water sports, the tourism here is strictly relative to the 
                        dry weather conditions and hence the span of December to April is the best time to visit Maldives. </p>

                    <p> The Maldives is a country that's actually an archipelago made up of 1,192 coral islands 
                        grouped into 26 coral atolls right in the Indian Ocean.
                        The islands that are a part of this country are located south-southwest 
                        of India and are considered part of Southern Asia. Generally speaking, 
                        the Maldives are safe for tourists since they mostly travel to its isolated 
                        islands usually meant for tourists. However, you shouldn't relax as it definitely 
                        isn't without its dangers. Be cautious and apply all precaution 
                        measures that you would stick to in your own country.</p>
